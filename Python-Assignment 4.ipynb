    "\n",
    "1. What exactly is []?\n",
    "Ans- The empty list value, which is a list value that contains no items.\n",
    "          This is similar to how” is the empty string value. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. In a list of values stored in a variable called spam, how would you assign the value 'hello' as the   third value? (Assume [2, 4, 6, 8, 10] are in spam.)\n",
    "Let's pretend the spam includes the list ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd'] for the next three queries.\n",
    "Ans- spam [2] =’hello’\n",
    "\n",
    "3. What is the value of spam [int (int ('3' * 2) / 11)]?\n",
    "Ans- ‘d’ (Note that ‘3’ * 2 is the string ‘33’, which is passed to int () before being divided by 11.\n",
    "           This eventually evaluates to 3. Expressions can be used wherever values are used.)\n",
    "\n",
    "4. What is the value of spam [-1]?\n",
    "Ans- ‘d’ (Negative indexes count from the end.)\n",
    "\n",
    "5. What is the value of spam [:2]?\n",
    "Let's pretend bacon has the list [3.14, 'cat,' 11, 'cat,' True] for the next three questions.\n",
    "Ans- [‘a’,’b’]\n",
    "\n",
    "6. What is the value of bacon. Index('cat')?\n",
    "Ans- 1\n",
    "\n",
    "7. How does bacon. Append (99) change the look of the list value in bacon?\n",
    "Ans- [3.14, ’cat’, 11, ‘cat’, True, 99]\n",
    "\n",
    "8. How does bacon. Remove('cat') change the look of the list in bacon?\n",
    "Ans- [3.14, 11, ‘cat’, True]\n",
    "\n",
    "9. What are the list concatenation and list replication operators?\n",
    "Ans- The operator for list concatenation is +, while the operator for replication is *. (This is the\n",
    "           same as for strings.)\n",
    "\n",
    "10. What is difference between the list methods append () and insert ()?\n",
    "Ans- While append () will add values only to the end of a list, insert () can add them anywhere in the \n",
    "         list. \n",
    "\n",
    "11. What are the two methods for removing items from a list?\n",
    "Ans-  The del statement and the remove values from a list. \t\n",
    "\n",
    "12. Describe how list values and string values are identical.\n",
    "Ans- Both lists and strings can be passed to len (), have indexes and slices, be used in for loops, be \n",
    "         Concatenated or replicated, and be used with the in and not in operators.\n",
    "\n",
    "13. What's the difference between tuples and lists?\n",
    "Ans- List are mutable; they can have values added, removed, or changed. Tuples are immutable;\n",
    "        they cannot be changed at all. Also, tuples are written using parentheses, (and), while lists use \n",
    "         the square brackets, [ and].\n",
    "\n",
    "14. How do you type a tuple value that only contains the integer 42?\n",
    "Ans- (42,) (The trailing comma is mandatory.)\n",
    "\n",
    "15. How do you get a list value's tuple form? How do you get a tuple value's list form?\n",
    "Ans- The tuple () and list () functions, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "16. Variables that \"contain\" list values are not necessarily lists themselves. Instead, what do they contain?\n",
    "Ans- They contain references to list values.\n",
    "\n",
    "17. How do you distinguish between copy.copy () and copy.deepcopy ()?\n",
    "Ans- The copy.copy() function will do a shallow copy of a list, while the copy.deepcopy() function will \n",
    "         do a deep copy of a list. That is, only copy.deepcopy() will duplicate any lists inside the list. \n"
