    "## 1. In the below elements which of them are values or an expression? eg: - values can be integer or string and expressions will be mathematical operators.\n",
    "* \n",
    "'hello'\n",
    "-87.8\n",
    "- \n",
    "/ \n",
    "+\t\n",
    "6 \n",
    "Ans-   Expression-*, -, /, +\n",
    "           Value- ‘hello’,-87.8, 6\n",
    "\n",
    "2. What is the difference between string and variable?\n",
    "Ans-String is the values inside the quotes assigned to a string.\n",
    "                                   And \n",
    "        Variable can store everything from strings to numbers.\n",

    "3. Describe three different data types.\n",
    "Ans- 1. Binary Data Type\n",
    "         2. Boolean Data Type\n",
    "         3. Numeric Data Type\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. What is an expression made up of? What do all expressions do?\n",
    "Ans-Expression made up of variable, operator and method invocation. All expression evaluates\n",
    "        To a single value. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "5. This assignment statements, like spam = 10. What is the difference between an expression and a statement?\n",
    "Ans-Expression: -  An expression evaluates to a single value.\n",
    "        Statement: - A statement does not.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "6. After running the following code, what does the variable bacon contain?\n",
    "bacon = 22\n",
    "bacon + 1\n",
    "Ans- The bacon variable is set to 22. The bacon +1 expression does not reassign the value in bacon.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "7. What should the values of the following two terms be?\n",
    "'spam' + 'spamspam'\n",
    "'spam' * 3\n",
    "Ans- Both expression evaluate to the String ‘spamspamspam’.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Why is eggs a valid variable name while 100 is invalid?\n",
    "Ans-Variable name cannot begin with a number. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "9. What three functions can be used to get the integer, floating-point number, or string version of a value?\n",
    "Ans-The int (), float (), and str () function will evaluate to the integer, floating-point number, and string versions of the value passed to them.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. Why does this expression cause an error? How can you fix it?\n",
    "'I have eaten ' + 99 + ' burritos.'\n",
    "Ans-The expression causes an error because 99 is an integer and only strings can be concatenated to other strings with the + operater. The correct way is I have eaten ‘ +  str(99) +’burritos’.\n",
