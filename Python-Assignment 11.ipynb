    "Ans- assert spam >=10, ‘The spam variable is less than 10.’\n",

    "2. Write an assert statement that triggers an AssertionError if the variables eggs and bacon contain strings that are the same as each other, even if their cases are different (that is, 'hello' and 'hello' are considered the same, and 'goodbye' and 'GOODbye' are also considered the same).\n",

    "Ans- DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR and CRITICAL\n",

    "Ans- logging.disable(logging.CRITICAL)\n",

    "8.Why is using logging messages better than using print() to display the same message?\n",
    "Ans- You can disable logging messages without removing the logging function calls.\n",
    "         You can selectively disable lower-level logging messages. You can create logging\n",
    "          messages. Logging messages provides a timestamp.\n",

    "9. What are the differences between the Step Over, Step In, and Step Out buttons in the debugger?\n",
    "Ans- The Step button will move the debugger into a function call. The Over button will quickly \n",
    "         execute the function call without stepping into it. The Out button will quickly execute the rest \n",
    "         of the code until it steps out of the function it currently is in.\n",

    "10.After you click Continue, when will the debugger stop?\n",

    "11. What is the concept of a breakpoint?\n",
